        <p>Since two of my favorite genres of movie are mystery and fantasy, Harry Potter becomes my most favorite movie from my childhood era until now. Harry Potter is film series based on the novels that written by J. K. Rowling and produced by Warnes Bros. Pictures. The movie consists of eight films or part with every part has a uniq and different story makes this movie is not boring to watch.</p>
    
        <p>Everytime I watch this movie, I feel like I am being brought to wizarding universe. Even though I watched this movie multiple times already, I never feel bored because every part of this movie always leaves the viewers with assumptions and curios about what will be happen in the next part. This movie also release each part pf the movie in different time, along with the growth of the characters, make me feel that this movie accompanying my growth from childhood to youth. There is an official website that can tell us which house that we will get if we go to Hogwarts based on our character. I got Gryffindor as my house, which is the same house with Harry Potter.</p>
