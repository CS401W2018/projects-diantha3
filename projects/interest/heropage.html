    <p>Ardhito Pramono is a jazz singer, music director, songwriter, and actor from Indonesia. He inspires me a lot in building the confident that I have in my musical talent. I was in the phase where I don't want to hone my talent in music anymore because I feel that I can't do it, but when listen to his song, I motivated to learn and hone my talent again. His songs always have a distinctive combination of instrument whether his voice and guitar or his voice and piano. The lyrics that he put in the song also beautiful and motivate. Here are my 3 top favorite songs:
        <dl>
            <dt>Bitter Love</dt>
            <dd>Song about love and family</dd>
            <dt>Sudah</dt>
            <dd>Song about peace</dd>
            <dt>Superstar</dt>
            <dd>Song about life</dd>
