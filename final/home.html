            <h4>Where your Fantasy becomes Reality!</h4>
            <p>
                Harry Potter is a title of a famous fantasy series created by author <em>J.K. Rowling</em>. It began as a series of seven novels following the journey of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasly (also called the Golden Trio) as they attend wizarding school of Hogwarts. The story revolves around their battle againts the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who seeks immortality and domination over both the wizarding and non-magical worlds (as known as Muggle people).

                Under the film production company of Warner Bros, the books were adapted into an equally iconic eight-part film series, which brought the magical world to life for millions of fans. Whether through books, movies, games, or fandom, Harry Potter continues to enchant people of all ages with its themes of friendship, courage, and the magical of love. For me personally, I haven't really read all the novel books but I watched the movie multiple times and it is always fun and never boring.
