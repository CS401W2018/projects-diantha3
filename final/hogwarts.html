            <p>Hogwarts School is a legendary magical institution located in the Scottish Highlands. It serves as the primary education center for young witches and wizards in the United Kingdom and has been the setting for many of the most iconic events in the Harry Potter series. The school is known not only for its enchanted architecture, and extraordinary faculty.</p>
            <p>Upon arrival at Hogwarts, each new student is sorted into one of four distinct houses, each representing different traits and values. Those four houses are Gryffinfor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff. These houses serve as both social communities and academic teams, with students earning and losing points throughout the year in pursuit of the House Cup.</p>

            <p>The Sorting process is conducted by the enchanted Sorting Hat, a magical object that reads a student's personality and tendencies to determine their best fit. In most cases, that hat makes an immediate decision, though it occasionally considers the student's personal preference with highlighted famously when Harry Potter requested not to be placed in Slytherin. Once sorted, students remain in that house throughout their years at Hogwarts, forming friendships, rivalries, and a strong sense of identity.</p>
